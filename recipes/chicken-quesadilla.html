        A chicken quesadilla is one of the easiest things to make and is wonderful if you need something on short notice or do not have many ingredients at your disposal. It can be spruced up or down incredibly easily which makes it a versatile dish that deserves a spot in your kitchen.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooked chicken breast
            <ul><li>If you don't have the time or desire to cook the chicken yourself, you can easily substitute with precooked canned chicken.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Tortilla(s)</li>
        <li>Shredded cheese
            <ul><li>I prefer a 3 cheese mix or a Mexican cheese blend, but you may use whatever cheese you like the most.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Optional Extras
            <ul>
                <li>Sour cream</li>
                <li>Guacamole</li>
                <li>Tomato salsa</li>
                <li>Black beans</li>
                <li>Peppers</li>
                <li>Onions</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The key to making a really good quesadilla is your pan heat. A slow cook on low heat will melt the cheese really well and give you a good color on the tortilla without burning it. Prep your pan by placing it on the burner on low heat.</li>
        <li>You have two options with tortillas, you can fold over one tortilla, or use two tortillas with on being placed on top of the other. Either way, make sure to put a slab of butter in the pan, then place your tortilla on top and slide it in circles to lube everything up.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cheese onto the tortilla in the pan. Try and make the cheese as even as possible on either half the tortilla or the whole tortilla depending on your method.</li>
        <li>Add your chicken. Spread as evenly as possible. Now would also be the time to add any extras like black beans, onions, or peppers.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle about half as much cheese on top of the chicken as you did on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Fold your tortilla in half or place another on top depending on your method.</li>
        <li>Squash your quesadilla into the pan to squeeze your ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Check the bottom of the quesadilla carefully using a spatula. In general it will be ready to flip we you notice that the cheese is starting to melt and is sticking to the top tortilla.</li>
        <li>Place another slab of butter on the uncooked side of your quesadilla, then carefully flip it over.</li>
        <li>Watch for melted cheese and whatever browning leel is desirable to you. Once the quesadilla is done, remove from pan and slice into quarters. Serve with sour cream or guacamole, or just as is.</li>
    </ol>
