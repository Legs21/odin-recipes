    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Steak is a classic meal, and contrary to popular belief, can be made just as well at home with the right ingredients and some practice. The theory and steps are actually very simple, and over time, developing a feel for how long to cook each side will come naturally. The real key to this recipe is having a solid cast iron skillet that can handle high heat and put a good sear on your steak without ruining it.
